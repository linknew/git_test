[Task-7]
I'm a serious man, take everything seriously.
Let's start the testing.
Before starting, do the following 8 steps (No mistake acceptable)
    git reset --hard
    git checkout master
    rm  * -rf
    git checkout -- ReadMe xianmei
    touch IamUntrackFile
    echo 'hello' >> ReadMe
    echo 'hello' >> xianmei
    git add ReadMe
Now, input "git status" and press 'enter'.
There comes the output. Explain them for me~

After that, you can use:
    rm * -rf
    git reset --hard
to recover the environments.
