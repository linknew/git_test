#definitions
#token
#    A sequence of characters considered a single unit by the shell. It
#    is either a word or an operator.
#metacharacter
#    A character that, when unquoted, separates words. A metacharacter
#    is a space, tab, newline, or one of the following characters: 
#    `|', `&', `;', `(', `)', `<', or `>'.
#word
#    A sequence of characters treated as a unit by the shell. Words may
#    not include unquoted metacharacters.
#name
#    A word consisting solely of letters, numbers, and underscores, and
#    beginning with a letter or underscore. Names are used as shell
#    variable and function names. Also referred to as an identifier.
#operator
#    A control operator or a redirection operator. See Redirections, for
#    a list of redirection operators. Operators contain at least one
#    unquoted metacharacter.
#control operator
#    A token that performs a control function. It is a newline or one of
#    the following: `||', `&&', `&', `;', `;;', `;&', `;;&', `|', `|&',
#    `(', or `)'.
#field
#    A unit of text that is the result of one of the shell expansions.
#    After expansion, when executing a command, the resulting fields are
#    used as the command name and arguments.
#Simple Commands
#    A simple command is the kind of command encountered most often. 
#    It's just a sequence of words separated by blanks, 
#    terminated by one of the shell's control operators. 
#    The first word generally specifies a command to be executed, 
#    with the rest of the words being that command's arguments.
#    The return status  of a simple command is its exit status as provided by 
#    the POSIX 1003.1 waitpid function, 
#    or 128+n if the command was terminated by signal n.
#Lists of Commands
#    A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the
#    operators `;', `&', `&&', or `||', 
#    and optionally terminated by one of `;',`&', or a newline.
#    Of these list operators, `&&' and `||' have equal precedence, 
#    followed by `;' and `&', which have equal precedence.
#============================================================================

#shell operation
#   The following is a brief description of the shell's operation when it 
#   reads and executes a command. Basically, the shell does the following:
#
#    1. Reads its input from a file, from a string supplied as an argument to 
#       the -c invocation option, or from the user's terminal.
#    2. Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules.
#       These tokens are separated by metacharacters.
#       Alias expansion is performed by this step.
#    3. Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands.
#    4. Performs the various shell expansions, breaking the expanded tokens 
#       into lists of filenames and commands and arguments.
#    5. Performs any necessary redirections and removes the 
#       redirection operators and their operands from the argument list.
#    6. Executes the command.
#    7. Optionally waits for the command to complete and 
#       collects its exit status.
#============================================================================

#quoting
#escape character
#    a non-quoted backslash `\' is the Bash escape character.
#    It preserves the literal value of the next character than follows, with
#    the exception of newline.
#    If a \newline pair appears, and the backslash iterslef is not quoted,
#    the \newline is treated as a line conitnuation.
#signal quotes
#    ignore all special meanings.
#double quotes
#    Enclosing characters in double quotes (`"') preserves the 
#    literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of 
#    `$', ``', `\', `!'(when history expansion is enabled).
#    When the shell is in POSIX mode, the `!' 
#    has no special meaning within double quotes, even when 
#    history expansion is enabled. 
#    The character `$' and ``' retain their special meaning within double quotes.
#    The backslash '\' retains its special meaning only when 
#    followed by one of the following characters: `$', ``', `"', `\', or newline. 
#    Within double quotes, backslashes that 
#    are followed by one of these characters are removed.
#    Backslashes preceding characters 
#    without a special meaning are left unmodified. 
#    A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by 
#    preceding it with a backslash. 
#    If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless
#    an `!' appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. 
#    The backslash preceding the `!' is not removed.
#ANSI-C quoting
#    $'string' ...
#locale-specific translation
#    $"string" ...
#============================================================================

#shell expansions
#Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into tokens. 
#There are seven kinds of expansion performed:
# * brace expansion
# * tilde expansion
# * parameter and variable expansion
# * arithmetic expansion
# * command substitution
# * word splitting
# * filename expansion
# * quote removal (after all expansions)
#
#Only brace expansion, word splitting, and filename expansion can 
#change the number of words of the expansion; 
#other expansions expand a single word to a single word. 
#The only exceptions to this are the expansions of "$@"  and "${name[@]}".
#
#brace expansion ...
#tilde expansion ...
#parameter expansion 
#    ${parameter:-word} ...
#    ${parameter:+word} ...
#    ${parameter:=word} ...
#    ${parameter:?word} ...

#    ...
#arithmetic expansion 
#    $(( expression )) ...
#command substitution
#    $(command) ...
#    `command` ...
#word splitting
#    The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, 
#    command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that 
#    did not occur within double quotes for word splitting.
#    Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.
